# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## PROMPTS
### Prompt Type 1: Zero-Shot Prompt
### Prompt:
"Summarize the article on 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology' in simple terms."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:
ChatGPT explained blockchain as a digital ledger where transactions are recorded in linked blocks, secured by cryptography, and used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:
Gemini described blockchain as a decentralized network that stores data transparently across many computers, emphasizing its use in secure transactions.

### Prompt Type 2: Few-Shot Prompt
### Prompt:
"Using the tech summaries as examples, briefly explain 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology.'"

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:
ChatGPT explained blockchain as a secure digital system where data is stored in linked blocks across many computers, helping make transactions safe and transparent.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:
Gemini described blockchain as a public, decentralized ledger that records transactions securely and is widely used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

### Prompt Type 3: Chain-of-Thought Prompt
### Prompt:
"What is blockchain? How does it work? Where is it used? Summarize clearly."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:
ChatGPT explained blockchain stepwise — a chain of blocks storing transactions, secured by cryptography, validated by a network, used in digital currencies and beyond.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:
Gemini broke down blockchain into components, describing its decentralized ledger, security features, and real-world uses like supply chain and finance.

### Prompt Type 4: Role-Based Prompt
### Prompt:
"Explain 'The Basics of Blockchain Technology' as if you are a professor teaching first-year students."

Tool A: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Output:
ChatGPT used a friendly, teaching tone: described blockchain as a tamper-proof digital notebook shared across many computers, highlighting examples like Bitcoin.

Tool B: Gemini (Google)

Output:
Gemini took a formal educator approach, explaining blockchain’s cryptographic basis and network consensus, using terms suitable for an introductory lecture.
